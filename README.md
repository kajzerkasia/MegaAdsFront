###  Mega Ads - Frontend Part

### Application implemented as part of the Mega K course: https://www.megak.pl/

- I changed by my own the stylesheets for Header and AddForm.
- I added the ability to move to the home page by clicking on the logo.

The application is a portal with ads. Each ad is located in a certain place on the map and has a link to an external site where you can buy a given item - e.g. on OLX or Allegro.

For the user, it is a map, as well as a space where can add some ads.

###  Available functionalities:
- Searching for ads on the map
- Adding an ad on the map
